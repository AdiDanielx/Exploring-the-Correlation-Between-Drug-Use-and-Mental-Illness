This  project delves into the correlation between drug use and mental illness, aiming to provide valuable insights into identifying mental health issues among individuals with a history of drug use. The dataset employed for this analysis contains records of individuals admitted to rehabilitation centers in the USA. By exploring this dataset, the project addresses the intricate challenge of detecting mental illness, often requiring prolonged assessments by experts.

To address this, the project builds a regression model capable of predicting mental illness among drug users based on their unique information. This predictive model has the potential to aid in recognizing mental health conditions in individuals, thereby enabling timely and appropriate care and treatment. 
The project aims to contribute to the understanding of the relationship between drug use and mental illness, ultimately improving the quality of care for affected individuals.
